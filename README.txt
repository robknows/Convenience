# Convenience

## A library for accessing super-powered functions from more powerful languages in the big friendly giant, Java.

I am aiming to implement functions for two types in particular - doubles and strings.

## Problem
I have become spoilt by the great power of high level functional array oriented programming in J, K and Q. OO is nice,
but I want the best of both worlds.

## Solution
A cute little array programming library!

## Notes

### Generic types for DoubleMonad and DoubleDyad
I have attempted to generify the DoubleMonad and DoubleDyad functions using generics with no success. If someone sees it, knows
straight away and enjoys the feeling of being smug (and very appreciated!) and wants to help me, that would be
fantastic.
