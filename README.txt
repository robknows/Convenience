# Convenience

The powerful list functions from more powerful APL derivative languages, implemented in Java for my convenience.
This includes higher order functions e.g. K's each adverbs, sliding windows, power over function rank as in J.

## Implemented

### Numbers

neg, reciprocal, sqrt, floor, ceiling, log, exp, abs, signum, add, times, minus, divide

### Arrays in general - note that these are constant functions in order to retain their generic array types.

distinct, reverse, take, drop

## Planned

### Verbs

head, behead, tail, curtail, first, last, index-of-first, index-of-last, where

raze, join, rotate, subarray, cross-product, asc/desc sorting, enumerate, fill, at-least/at-most

string padding

Q's sv/vs

### Adverbs

N-ary sliding window

J's insert, prefix, suffix

K's fold, converge, iterate

K's functional amend

J's power adverb  (^:)
