# Convenience

## A library for accessing super-powered functions from more powerful languages in the big friendly giant, Java.

## Problem
I have become spoilt by the great power of high level functional array oriented programming in J, K and Q. OO is nice,
but I want the best of both worlds.

## Solution
A cute little array programming library!
